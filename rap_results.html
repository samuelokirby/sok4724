Each unique result I post here are trained off of various artists' works. I mainly took some of the most popular rappers and saw what they could come up with. Also, I removed explicit words for obvious reasons.
<i>(warning: some of these are hilariously bad)</i>

<b style="font-size: 28px;"> Logic </b>
    <i>
    "I'm sick of it, all of you fake *** rappers are plain
    This time I can't stand it, y'all sound the same"

    "I've been to New York, you want as a champ, you can
    He ain't even want to be here when your grandmother was bit by a man"

    </i>

<b style="font-size: 28px; padding-bottom: 100px;"> Kanye West </b>
    <i>
    "See how easy it is not a man
    When it comes to those 3 things all it was part of my dark plan"
    
    "I can barely hear you Naw, you clear You cool? you mad?
    Bring back my old self, call it my dad"

    “Mindframe of a genius, see you lazy like McGrady so you'll never retire number one 
    I’m in it for the bands I wouldn't win this if it wasn’t for the long run”

<b style="font-size: 28px; padding-bottom: 100px;"> J. Cole </b>
    <i>
    “I do this more for you 
    I'll drop the rhyme, make her keep that part of the raps that you could never measure to”

    "Begging me to rap please, just leave me starving? Im still spending Lux money
    if Love left the stage it's not funny"
