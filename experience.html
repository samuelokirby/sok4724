            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Recurrent Neural Network for Sentence Generation - Game of Thrones</b><br>
            Recently I created a RNN using Google's Python library <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>Keras.</b>
            I designed this RNN to predict try to generate the next letter of a given character
            to generate text based off of a source. My most impressive results were from using
            all of the <i>Game of Thrones</i> novels together as a source. Using the RNN, I was
            able to generate a new "chapter" of Game of Thrones. While the new chapter doesn't
            make much sense contextually, the results are still impressive.<br>
            If you would like to take a look at what it generated, I made a link <b>here</b>
            to look at the results.

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Lil' Lexie - HackDartmouth V Winner</b><br>
            Using <b>natural language processing</b> and some minor discrete mathematics, my friends
            and I created a rap battle bot that used Amazon's Alexa to both hear what the user is
            saying and to also rap back at the user. To generate sentences, we created a custom
            version of <b>Markov Chains</b> and "funneled" the results into a context-free grammar.
            The end result was a robot that could rap back at you using things that you said to it
            as a way to contextualize its rebuttal.

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Rap Lyric Generator - Machine Learning & NLP</b><br>
            This past summer, using my experience with sentence generation when I created my RNN
            and my experience with creating a rap bot, I made a rap lyric generator. This project
            was one of my more interesting ones because I combined two of my past projects into
            one. I created a RNN the same way I did before, but only this time changed it so
            that it would try and take rhyme scheme into consideration. Then, I used
            Markov Chains to create reliable sentence structure. The end result was
            actually very impressive; if you would like to see them, I made a link
            <b>here.</b>

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Footnote - Chrome Extension, Front-End, Security, & Server Management</b><br>
            Footnote was the project that I did at my first hackathon. The idea behind Footnote
            was allowing users to comment on any web page, regardless of whether or not
            the page had a comments section on it. We accomplished this by generating a custom
            "page" per unique URL that all users could comment on and see comments on. We also
            thought it would be important to have accounts on the platform, so we created
            our own account system from scratch. Another obstacle hit us when we were creating
            an account system which was security. In order to create secure passwords for our
            accounts, we had to hash the password in such a way that even we couldn't read it.
            The end result was hack-y, but it did work. You can see more <b>here.</b>

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Clipboard+ - Chrome Extension, Web Design</b><br>
            My <u>current</u> project that I am working on right now is a Google Chrome extension
            that improves the current way that clipboards work. I am trying to make a system
            that creates multiple clipboards that you can copy and paste from with keyboard
            shortcuts, and also add a copy and paste history log like Samsung phones have.
            The project is harder than I thought it would be to complete - there are a lot of
            cases where you cannot use JavaScript normally to create a custom copy and
            paste function.

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Minecraft Servers - Server Management, Marketing, & Programming (2012 - 2016)<br></b>
            When I was younger I created various server networks for the popular video game Minecraft.
            In order to entice players to join, I learned how to use video and photo editing software
            to create flashy advertisements, which I would then promote on various websites to
            get people to join. I also had to learn how to use Java and mySQL to manage player
            databases and create administration tools. At my height, I ran a network with 
            roughly 60,000 unique users. My experience with Minecraft servers was a forging moment
            for me and it really set me off into the field of computers.

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Research Assistant - Center for CyberSecurity @ Rochester Institute of Technology</b><br>
            I am currently employed as a Research Assistant for the Rochester Institute of Technology at
            the Center for Cybersecurity. I am working on two key projects - the first being a deepfake
            detection algorithm that would be able to universally detect whenever a video has been
            created using deepfake algorithms to swap faces. The second project is trying to stop website fingerprinting
			on the Tor browser. Website fingerprinting is one of the only known attacks that can be used
			against Tor users to detect which websites they are browsing. It has the capability of breaking 
			the anonymity that defines the Tor project and its purpose.
			The experience is very educating yet humbling, as I now know that I really
            don't know anything about artificial intelligence compared to the people that are pushing
            the industry today.
            I work under
            <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/mkwics-matthew-wright">Professor Matthew Right</a>. You can see
            a list of his publications

            <b style="font-size: 28px;">Publicist - RIT Artificial Intelligence Club</b><br>
            Currently, I serve as a board member on the RIT-AI Club here at my school. My main job is to
            create advertisements and foster outreach for new members, however I do a lot of presentations
            on various Machine Learning and AI topics. My most recent presentation was actually on natural
            language processing and its applications, where I used my various rap bots that I have
            developed as examples. The AI Club is a great network where we bring like-minded students
            together to talk about the future of artificial intelligence, and I am proud to say I am
            serving as a key member.
