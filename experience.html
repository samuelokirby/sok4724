    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Recurrent Neural Network for Sentence Generation - Game of Thrones</b><br>
    		Recently I created a RNN using Google's Python library <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>Keras.</b>
    		I designed this RNN to predict try to generate the next letter of a given character
    		to generate text based off of a source. My most impressive results were from using
    		all of the <i>Game of Thrones</i> novels together as a source. Using the RNN, I was
    		able to generate a new "chapter" of Game of Thrones. While the new chapter doesn't
    		make much sense contextually, the results are still impressive.<br>
    		If you would like to take a look at what it generated, I made a link <a href="rnn_results.html">here</a>
    		to look at the results.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Lil' Lexie - HackDartmouth V Winner</b><br>
    		Using <b>natural language processing</b> and some minor discrete mathematics, my friends
    		and I created a rap battle bot that used Amazon's Alexa to both hear what the user is
    		saying and to also rap back at the user. To generate sentences, we created a custom
    		version of <b>Markov Chains</b> and "funneled" the results into a context-free grammar.
    		The end result was a robot that could rap back at you using things that you said to it
    		as a way to contextualize its rebuttal. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/lil_lexie">Here</a> is the
            DevPost blog that we posted this on.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Rap Lyric Generator - Machine Learning & NLP</b><br>
    		This past summer, using my experience with sentence generation when I created my RNN
    		and my experience with creating a rap bot, I made a rap lyric generator. This project
    		was one of my more interesting ones because I combined two of my past projects into
    		one. I created a RNN the same way I did before, but only this time changed it so
    		that it would try and take rhyme scheme into consideration. Then, I used
    		Markov Chains to create reliable sentence structure. The end result was
    		actually very impressive; if you would like to see them, I made a link
    		<a href="rap_results.html">here</a>.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Footnote - Chrome Extension, Front-End, Security, & Server Management</b><br>
    		Footnote was the project that I did at my first hackathon. The idea behind Footnote
    		was allowing users to comment on any web page, regardless of whether or not
    		the page had a comments section on it. We accomplished this by generating a custom
    		"page" per unique URL that all users could comment on and see comments on. We also
    		thought it would be important to have accounts on the platform, so we created
    		our own account system from scratch. Another obstacle hit us when we were creating
    		an account system which was security. In order to create secure passwords for our
    		accounts, we had to hash the password in such a way that even we couldn't read it.
    		The end result was hack-y, but it did work. You can see more <a href="install.html">here</a>.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Clipboard+ - Chrome Extension, Web Design</b><br>
    		My <u>current</u> project that I am working on right now is a Google Chrome extension
    		that improves the current way that clipboards work. I am trying to make a system
    		that creates multiple clipboards that you can copy and paste from with keyboard
    		shortcuts, and also add a copy and paste history log like Samsung phones have.
    		The project is harder than I thought it would be to complete - there are a lot of
    		cases where you cannot use JavaScript normally to create a custom copy and
    		paste function.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Minecraft Servers - Server Management, Marketing, & Programming (2012 - 2016)<br></b>
    		When I was younger I created various server networks for the popular video game Minecraft.
    		In order to entice players to join, I learned how to use video and photo editing software
    		to create flashy advertisements, which I would then promote on various websites to
    		get people to join. I also had to learn how to use Java and mySQL to manage player
    		databases and create administration tools. At my height, I ran a network with 
    		roughly 60,000 unique users. My experience with Minecraft servers was a forging moment
    		for me and it really set me off into the field of computers.

            <b style ="font-size: 28px;">Sam-Bot - Full-Stack, Database & API Integration<br></b>
            You may have seen Sam-Bot on your way here - it's the chat bot I made for this website.
            I made Sam-Bot mostly for fun, but also as a way to answer questions that people might
            have about me that aren't listed anywhere else. Sam-Bot was a challenging project to
            implement. I used Google's Dialogflow to handle intents and user input, JavaScript and jQuery to make it look nice, and a little bit of php. I also had to rent out a remote
            Linux machine to run the code on, because all of the hosts that I tried to run it
            on only supported static programs, whereas Sam-Bot requires a dynamic site. I setup
            an Apache server on the Linux machine and then bought the domain samuel.tech to use
            as a custom URL. Overall, I am very pleased with the results.


    <h1>Experience</h1><br>

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Research Assistant - Center for CyberSecurity @ Rochester Institute of Technology</b><br>
    		I am currently employed as a Research Assistant for the Rochester Institute of Technology at
    		the Center for Cybersecurity. I am working on two key projects - the first being a deepfake
    		detection algorithm that would be able to universally detect whenever a video has been
    		created using deepfake algorithms to swap faces. The second project is a video fingerprinting
    		Tor project, where we are trying to find a method to fingerprint videos when they are
    		hosted on Tor-enabled websites. The experience is very educating yet humbling, as I now know that I really
    		don't know anything about artificial intelligence compared to the people that are pushing
    		the industry today.

    		<b style="font-size: 28px;">Publicist - RIT Artificial Intelligence Club</b><br>
    		Currently, I serve as a board member on the RIT-AI Club here at my school. My main job is to
    		create advertisements and foster outreach for new members, however I do a lot of presentations
    		on various Machine Learning and AI topics. My most recent presentation was actually on natural
    		language processing and its applications, where I used my various rap bots that I have
    		developed as examples. The AI Club is a great network where we bring like-minded students
    		together to talk about the future of artificial intelligence, and I am proud to say I am
    		serving as a key member.
